### Source Code

Hallo!
This is my first tutorial on PSC.
I hope you like this code.
<p>This code gets all files in a folder (you can also use a filter) and stores these files in an archive. While it is doing this it is showing you the progress in an picturebox.</p>
<p>For example it can be used to store files and extract them at runtime, so the user can't copy them.</p>
Good and easy code!
<p>You only have to put the two functions and the sub into your project. Then you only call one of the two functions!!!</p>
